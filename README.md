Sneakerhead Trivia Game

This application was a personal project that I created for fun.
Test your wits against the sneakerhead trivia game, with over 7000 Jordans from all years to quiz yourself on. Do you really know your stuff?

## Description
An interactive application in which the basic premise is to guess the details of the shoe that is presented to you. This includes various fields, which are worth a different amount of points, including:
- Release Year: 300 points
- Name: 300 points
- Model: 300 points
- Gender: 100 points

Totaling 1000 points for 1 correctly guessed shoe.
After 10 guesses, the game is over and a total score out of 10,000 points possible will be displayed for the user to revel in.

## Technologies
MongoDB, React, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js

A third-party API was used to ETL the MongoDB with data for quick load time and cost reduction.
